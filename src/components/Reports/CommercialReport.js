      <SectionTitle>Competitive Landscape</SectionTitle>
      <p>
        The functional beverage market features a diverse competitive landscape with four primary competitor types:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Global Beverage Leaders (38% market share):</strong> Companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestl√© are rapidly expanding their functional beverage portfolios 
        through both internal innovation and acquisitions of successful smaller brands. They leverage extensive distribution networks and marketing power but often struggle 
        with agility in responding to emerging trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Established Specialty Players (46% market share):</strong> Companies focused primarily on functional beverages with strong brand equity in specific benefit areas. 
        These companies typically have 10+ years of market presence and well-developed retail relationships. They benefit from focused expertise but face increasing pressure 
        from both larger and smaller competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Emerging Disruptors (12% market share but growing at 35% annually):</strong> Venture-backed startups targeting niche functional benefits or novel ingredient combinations. 
        They typically launch direct-to-consumer and expand into retail as they grow. This group sees the highest rate of both new entrants and failures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Private Label (4% market share but growing at 19% annually):</strong> Retailer-owned brands are increasing their presence in the functional beverage space, 
        particularly in functional waters and plant-based segments. They typically compete on price while closely mimicking successful branded products.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competitive intensity varies significantly by segment and channel, with plant-based functional beverages and mental performance drinks seeing the highest rates of new product introduction.
